2014-04-25 Version 1.0.0

	Parallel object maps are now stored in the Rubyverse instead
	of the original object so that they can go away when the Rubyverse
	does. Object#in_rubyverse now calls Rubyverse#rubyversed (which is
	now responsible for invoking Rubyverse#rubyverse_new to create the
	new object).

	Accordingly, Object#rubyverse_map is now Rubyverse#rubyverse_map.

2014-04-13 Version 0.0.1

	First release.
